lua-resty-snappy
================

`lua-resty-snappy` provides LuaJIT FFI bindings to Snappy, a fast compressor/decompressor (https://code.google.com/p/snappy/).

## Installation

Just place [`snappy.lua`](https://github.com/bungle/lua-resty-snappy/blob/master/lib/resty/snappy.lua) somewhere in your `package.path`, preferably under `resty` directory. If you are using OpenResty, the default location would be `/usr/local/openresty/lualib/resty`.

### Compiling and Installing Snappy C-library

1. Install snappy with your operating system's package management OR build it manually from the sources provided from
   [Snappy repository](https://code.google.com/p/snappy/).
2. Check that you have `snappy.so` (or `.dylib`, or `.dll`) in Lua's `package.cpath` (or modify `snappy.lua` and point `ffi_load("snappy")`
   with full path to `snappy.so`, e.g. `local json = ffi_load("/usr/local/lib/lua/5.1/snappy.so")`).

### Using LuaRocks or MoonRocks

This will only install the Lua module, not the Snappy C-library.

If you are using LuaRocks >= 2.2:

```Shell
$ luarocks install lua-resty-snappy
```

If you are using LuaRocks < 2.2:

```Shell
$ luarocks install --server=http://rocks.moonscript.org moonrocks
$ moonrocks install lua-resty-snappy
```

MoonRocks repository for `lua-resty-snappy`  is located here: https://rocks.moonscript.org/modules/bungle/lua-resty-snappy.

## Lua API

#### Error Codes

```c
  SNAPPY_OK               = 0,
  SNAPPY_INVALID_INPUT    = 1,
  SNAPPY_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL = 2
```

#### string,len snappy.compress(input)

Compresses `input` with Snappy algorithm, and returns compressed data and its length.
On error this will return nil and an error code.

##### Example

```lua
local snappy    = require "resty.snappy"
local comp, err = snappy.compress("test")
if comp then
    -- do something with compressed data and length
    -- (length is stored in err value)...
else
    if err = 1 then
        print "Invalid input"
    elseif err == 2 then
        print "Buffer too small"
    end
end
```

#### string,len snappy.uncompress(compressed)

Uncompresses `compressed` with Snappy algorithm, and returns uncompressed data and its length.
On error this will return nil and an error code.

##### Example

```lua
local snappy      = require "resty.snappy"
local uncomp, err = snappy.uncompress(snappy.compress("test"))
```

#### number snappy.max_compressed_length(source_length)

Returns maximum-possible length as a number of bytes of compressed data when
uncompressed `source_length` is given. This is used to create buffer for compressing,
but can also be used in quick measurement (and it may have nothing to do with
final compressed output length, other than it cannot be larger than what this
function returns).

##### Example

```lua
local snappy = require "resty.snappy"
local number = snappy.max_compressed_length(1000)
```

#### number snappy.uncompressed_length(compressed)

This is quicker way (than using `snappy.uncompress` to determine how many bytes
the compressed data will be when it is uncompressed.

##### Example

```lua
local snappy = require "resty.snappy"
local number = snappy.uncompressed_length(snappy.compress("test"))
```

#### boolean snappy.validate_compressed_buffer(compressed)

This can be used to check if the compressed bytes are actually Snappy compressed
bytes or something else. I.e. something that can be uncompressed with Snappy.

##### Example

```lua
local snappy = require "resty.snappy"
local bool   = snappy.validate_compressed_buffer(snappy.compress("test"))
```
